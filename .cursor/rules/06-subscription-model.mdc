# Subscription Model

Memor uses a tiered subscription model to provide different levels of AI functionality.

## Subscription Tiers

1. **Free Tier**
   - Basic note-taking functionality
   - Limited AI queries per day
   - Local storage with sync

2. **Pro Tier**
   - Increased AI query limits
   - Advanced RAG features
   - Priority processing

3. **Enterprise Tier**
   - Unlimited AI queries
   - Custom AI model options
   - Team collaboration features

## Implementation

- Subscription management in [memor-backend/src/services/subscriptionService.ts](mdc:memor-backend/src/services/subscriptionService.ts)
- Stripe integration in [memor-backend/src/services/paymentService.ts](mdc:memor-backend/src/services/paymentService.ts)
- Frontend subscription UI in [memor/features/subscription/SubscriptionScreen.tsx](mdc:memor/features/subscription/SubscriptionScreen.tsx)
- Subscription hooks in [memor/hooks/useSubscription.ts](mdc:memor/hooks/useSubscription.ts)

## Usage Tracking

- AI query usage is tracked in [memor-backend/src/middleware/usageTrackingMiddleware.ts](mdc:memor-backend/src/middleware/usageTrackingMiddleware.ts)
- Limits are enforced based on subscription tier
