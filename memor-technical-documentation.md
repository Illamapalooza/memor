## I. Introduction

### A. Project Overview

Memor is an AI-powered note-taking application that combines traditional note management capabilities with advanced artificial intelligence features. Utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Memor enables users to interact with their notes through natural language queries, receive contextually relevant responses, and manage information efficiently with a local-first architecture that maintains cloud synchronization.

### B. Problem Statement

Traditional note-taking apps often lack intelligent retrieval mechanisms, making it difficult for users to extract value from their accumulated knowledge. As information volume grows, the cognitive load of organizing, searching, and connecting related concepts becomes overwhelming. Current solutions either focus solely on storage or provide limited AI capabilities that aren't deeply integrated with the user's personal knowledge base. Memor addresses this gap by creating a seamless integration between personal notes and advanced AI technologies.

### C. Objectives

- Create a mobile-first note-taking application with a focus on reliability through local-first architecture
- Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide contextually relevant AI responses based on user notes
- Develop a subscription-based model that offers different tiers of AI functionality while providing core note-taking features for free
- Enable multimodal interaction through both text and audio interfaces for note creation and AI queries
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility with primary focus on Android followed by iOS support

### D. Target Users & Stakeholders

- Knowledge workers who need to organize and retrieve information efficiently
- Students who require smart study tools to manage course notes and research materials
- Professionals who regularly document meetings, ideas, and research findings
- Content creators who need to organize thoughts and retrieve reference materials
- Teams and organizations seeking to implement knowledge management solutions

## VII. Lessons Learned and Future Enhancements

### A. Key Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of Memor, several valuable lessons emerged:

1. Local-First Architecture: Implementing a truly offline-capable application required more consideration than initially anticipated. The team learned to prioritize local storage operations and treat synchronization as a background process, significantly improving user experience in poor connectivity scenarios.

2. AI Cost Management: Early implementations of the RAG pipeline were inefficient in token usage, leading to higher than expected costs. Implementing stricter chunking strategies, context limits, and caching mechanisms proved essential for maintaining cost-effectiveness.

3. Cross-Platform Challenges: Despite using Expo, platform-specific issues required more customization than expected. Platform-specific code proved necessary for optimal performance, particularly for audio recording and filesystem interactions.

4. State Management Complexity: As the application grew, managing state became increasingly complex. The team learned to better architect the state management approach, establishing clearer boundaries between global and component state.

5. Testing Importance: Comprehensive testing, particularly for offline scenarios and synchronization edge cases, proved invaluable in identifying subtle bugs before they reached users.

### B. Challenges Faced

The team encountered several significant challenges during development:
